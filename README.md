# Student Info Manager
- A backend for making managing students info easier and faster for schools.
- i created it using MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js.

## Note

- This repo contains only the backend code.
- `node_modules` is not included due to my internet speed and its large size - run `npm install` to get all dependencies before trying to run the code.
- You'll need MongoDB installed and running on your system.
- Make sure you have the latest Node.js installed.

## optional 

- Install MongoDB Compass for easier database management.
- Postman or a similar API testing tool is recommended for testing endpoints, this is a must it made my job a lot easier .
